The pig is pink
Look at the cat
I live in a house
The apple is red
I have five flowers
The ball is green
I like to play
The jar has a lid
The swan is white
The van is blue
The sun is hot
I see the bus
I have a bat
My crayon colour is Red
The girl has long hair
This is an ant
Earth has one moon
The dog plays
The boy bathes the cat
I go to school in bus
I have a ball at home
I have a pet dog at home
I have a small bed
I have elder brother
I eat bananas
